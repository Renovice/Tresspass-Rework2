1.Follow the project’s linting/formatting style (e.g., ESLint, Black, Prettier).
2.Write docstrings and comments for complex logic.
3.Follow the project’s file/folder structure.
4.Use existing utility functions or libraries instead of reinventing them.
5. USE BEPINEX plugin (its the only way to load mods into the game in dll form)
6. Try to use R2API when possible as a Convention and also prefer on hooks over harmony patches (in general if possible without sacrificing functionality) 
7. Try to Write the code as short and as simple as possible BUT only if absolutely possible without sacrificing performance and functionality. 
8. Dont invent Things we are not 100% sure of, if you dont know ask the user if he knows the given identifier of the code ur refrencing or changing. 
9. try to minimize changing existing code, just focus on the given task at hand unidemnsionally IE if someone tells u to add 1+1,  dont statt adding more stuff or "refining" his other code focus on the task given
10. Before adding anything to existing code familarize urself with the convention it uses like Bepinex or r2api OR risk of options documentation
