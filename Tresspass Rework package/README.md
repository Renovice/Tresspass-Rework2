# Tresspass tweaks a mod for generally improving and making trespass more versatile
Main changes: Makes both corrupted and normal tresspass work the same way.

Tap shift to trigger a short forward dash just like corrupted dash from vanilla BUT for both trespass versions, both in corrupte and regular mode.
Hold shift to trigger a longer dash with an upward arc. Just like regular trespass but again available for both modes.

The mod also provides a toggle for a non cancellable mode where if u hold shift and the upward arc animation starts, it will not end until max duration is reached,  regardless if you let go of the shift key.
